# 🌟 North Star Prompt: SQL Server + REST API + RShiny Integration

## 🎯 Objective:
Build confidence and core skills across backend, API, and frontend integration by designing a simple system that connects a **SQL Server database**, exposes a **REST API**, and visualizes data in an interactive **RShiny dashboard**.

---

## 🧠 Prompt:

I want you to act as a Senior AI Engineer and Technical Mentor. My goal is to become a confident, self-sufficient app developer by working on projects that stretch my skills but don’t overwhelm me.

Here’s what I’d like to build:

> A basic end-to-end workflow that uses **SQL Server** as the database, a **REST API** for querying data, and **RShiny** as the frontend to display charts and interactive dashboards.

Please help me:

1. **Design the architecture** (brief diagram or bullet explanation)
2. Choose the best **free or open-source tools** to get started
3. Recommend beginner-friendly **R packages** and **API frameworks**
4. Write a **sample SQL schema** and a few mock records to simulate the data
5. Provide **boilerplate REST API code** (Node.js, Flask, or .NET Core preferred)
6. Offer **RShiny starter code** that fetches from the API and builds one plot
7. Explain where I should store code (e.g. GitHub repo, folders, best practices)
8. Include tips for **error handling**, testing, and documenting the project
9. Bonus: Suggest ways to make this project *resume-ready* or presentable in interviews

---

## 💡 Who This Is For:
Beginner–intermediate devs transitioning into AI or data-driven roles, especially those from non-traditional backgrounds. This prompt scaffolds confidence through real skills.

---

## ✅ Ideal Output:
- Sample database schema
- API setup with 2 endpoints (e.g. `/get-data`, `/healthcheck`)
- RShiny UI script with 1–2 visuals (e.g. bar or line plot)
- GitHub repo structure or template recommendation
- A short “Why This Project Matters” explanation

---

## 🔗 Bonus:
If I finish this, suggest **Project 2** in the North Star track:  
> "Using Azure Data Factory to move data from SQL Server to a cloud data lake — and visualize it in RShiny."
