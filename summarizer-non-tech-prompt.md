# ðŸ“„ AI-Enhanced Document Summarizer Prompt (No-Code Friendly)

## Objective:
Youâ€™re an individual contributor who regularly works with long technical, policy, or systems documents but doesnâ€™t want to waste time manually extracting key insights. You want a tool that can **summarize content** and **highlight actionable takeaways** â€” without needing to build it from scratch.

## Prompt:
I want you to act as an AI assistant that can read and summarize long technical or policy-based documents.

Here's what I need:
1. Summarize this document in **plain, non-technical language**.
2. Highlight any **calls to action, deadlines, or process changes** I should be aware of.
3. Identify key stakeholders or systems referenced.
4. Offer a **one-paragraph TL;DR** I could share with a teammate or manager.
5. Suggest how this document **affects my work as a systems-level contributor**.

Paste the document or provide the link (if public and accessible).

## Ideal Use Case:
Daily support for reviewing onboarding manuals, security protocols, enterprise tech memos, or customer contracts â€” especially useful when working in cross-functional roles.
