# ðŸ§  Personalized AI Learning Tracker Prompt

## Objective:
Youâ€™re learning AI, coding, and systems design on your own â€” without a structured bootcamp or official mentor. You want AI to help you stay on track, reflect on your growth, and build confidence without overwhelm.

## Prompt:
Act as an AI Learning Mentor.

Please help me:
1. Build a **weekly learning plan** based on 3â€“5 hours/week availability.
2. Recommend 1 resource each for **AI fundamentals, systems design, and front-end dev**.
3. Track what Iâ€™ve learned so far and **suggest what I should learn next**.
4. Reflect back my **biggest skill gain this month**.
5. Offer a mini milestone project I can build in the next 10 days.
6. Remind me how this fits my long-term goal to become a solo app builder in a cloud-based environment.

Optional: Suggest a motivating quote or reflection question at the end of each session.

## Ideal Use Case:
Beginner-to-intermediate learners in cloud software, AI, and app building â€” especially those transitioning into tech from other careers.
