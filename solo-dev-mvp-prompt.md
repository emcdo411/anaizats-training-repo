# ðŸ§° AI Prompt: Solo Developer MVP Builder

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To guide Anaizat in building a simple but realistic MVP (minimum viable product) that uses AI features while accommodating her preference for solo development and individual contributor work.

---

## ðŸ§  Prompt
> You are a full-stack AI product engineer helping a solo developer build their first AI-enhanced app. The goal is to create a basic, working MVP for a web-based **task tracker** or **digital wellness journal**.
>
> As my AI engineering guide, please:
> 1. Recommend the best lightweight tech stack for a solo dev (front-end + back-end + database)
> 2. Walk me through adding one AI feature (examples: chatbot, habit predictor, mood analysis)
> 3. Keep scope small but real â€” MVP only
> 4. Offer optional ideas for a Phase 2 once Iâ€™ve mastered the basics

- Kickstart a project you can show in interviews
- Practice the full app development lifecycle
- Build your GitHub portfolio

## ðŸ”„ Output Should Include:
- Stack suggestions
- AI feature breakdown
- API examples or datasets (if needed)
- Deployment suggestions (like Render, Netlify, or Replit)

## ðŸš€ Future Expansion
This prompt can evolve to:
